I use this layout for my Unicorne LP by https://boardsource.xyz

# <font color="#6796e6">0: Graphite Lower</font>

I use the Graphite keyboard layout https://github.com/rdavison/graphite-layout. The main homerow keys are NRTS and HAEI, so all layers are focused around these positions. I originally used Colemak DH, which was a massive improvement over QWERTY, but still had some awkward combinations.

<font color="#A6E22E">**Ctrl Z**</font> gives me quick access to Undo and Redo is mapped to the same key one layer up.

The <font color="#FD971F">**MO(1)**</font> and <font color="#FD971F">**MO(2)**</font> keys will change layers to Navigation or Code while held individually.

# <font color="#F44747">1: Navigation / Numpad</font>

When using a split keyboard, it is important that all of the navigation keys are on the side opposite the mouse. This allows me to click code with my right hand and navigate it with my left at the same time. 

<font color="#A6E22E">**Ctrl-Shift-F**</font> is used to bring up the Search In All Files bar in VS Code.

<font color="#A6E22E">**Shift-Home**</font> is used to select text from the current cursor position to the start of the line.

<font color="#A6E22E">**Win-E**</font> opens a Windows File Explorer window.

I added an <font color="#A6E22E">**Enter**</font> key since I want to be able to use it while navigating with the mouse.

<font color="#A6E22E">**Delete**</font> is in an awkward position while holding the left layer button, but I rarely use it.

<font color="#A6E22E">**Ctrl Y**</font> gives me quick access to Redo and Undo is mapped to the same key one layer down.

Pressing the <font color="#FD971F">**OSL(3)**</font> thumb key on the right (at this point I am still holding the left layer key) will toggle the Uppercase layer. I can let go of both thumb keys and type a single uppercase letter or hold both to continue typing in uppercase.

# <font color="#b267e6">2: Code / Symbols</font>

The 8 symbols on the homerow locations are my most used coding symbols

<font color="#FD971F">**Calc**</font> opens the Windows Calculator. The Media keys let me control music in Spotify.

Pressing the <font color="#FD971F">**OSL(3)**</font> thumb key on the left (at this point I am still holding the right layer key) will toggle the Uppercase layer. I can let go of both thumb keys and type a single uppercase letter or hold both to continue typing in uppercase.

# <font color="#F92672">3: Graphite Upper</font>

Keeping the uppercase letters on a separate layer triggered by the thumbs allows me to touch type as normal since the Shift key is on the side and would normally throw things off.

An alternative approach would be to swap Ctrl and Shift so I can write uppercase while holding Shift. The downside of this is that you have to stretch to capitalize letters like B, while the OSL key allows me toggle the caps layer, lift my thumbs, and then type a little more comfortably.

I use the top-right key to trigger another layer that I use to control my keyboard's RGB.
